[Lisa] messing with things to cause trouble and stuff.... because it is

How in the world do you use nano[bots] on Mars?
You know how John Boone feels about that.

[Lisa] Dracula's favorite color is far more likely to be black and 
Wolfman may well love being a wolf multiple times per month on a mulit moon planet.

I agree--plus, Wolfman would probably get along quite well with Nirgal and the underground rebels. Dracula is an 
aristocrat, though--he might side with the transnat corporations :/

We really must consider what other monsters would join this expedition

would he shift in transit and rampage through the spaceship leading to 
its ultimate demise?
