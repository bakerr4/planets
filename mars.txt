[Lisa] messing with things to cause trouble and stuff.... because it is 
the dream of 
humanity
How in the world do you use nano[bots] on Mars?
You know how John Boone feels about that.
But Hiroko definitely believes we need to keep moving forward in order to make something new 
[Lisa] Dracula's favorite color is far more likely to be black and 
Wolfman may well love being a wolf multiple times per month on a mulit moon planet.

I agree--plus, Wolfman would probably get along quite well with Nirgal and the underground rebels. Dracula is an 
aristocrat, though--he might side with the transnat corporations :/

We really must consider what other monsters would join this expedition 
and what their travel needs may be... can wolfman even travel to Mars or 
would he shift in transit and rampage through the spaceship leading to 
its ultimate demise?

##Rebecca Additions
You're right--we might need to put him in suspended animation for the trip. Of course, if he can't SEE the moon, 
perhaps it won't affect him?
